Forecasting U.S. Outbound Travel Demand with Hybrid Machine Learning Models 


While existing studies such as: Air Travel Demand Forecasting with Big Data, Predictive Modeling of Air Travel Demand Using Machine Learning, Personalized Travel Recommendation Systems Using Machine Learning. These studies have applied machine learning to various aspects of travel demand forecasting. My proposal aims to uniquely combine a variety of machine learning models, including both traditional machine learning algorithms (like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) and newer deep learning approaches (such as LSTM and GRU). This hybrid approach is designed to evaluate and identify the most effective methodologies for forecasting travel specifically from the U.S. to various global regions, a comparative analysis that is less frequently explored in current literature.

The significance of my work lies in its potential to refine forecasting methods specifically for U.S. outbound travel, a key economic and cultural facet influencing not only the travel industry but also international relations and economic policies.
